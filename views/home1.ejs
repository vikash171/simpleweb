      <h1 class="heading">Meditation Under the Bodhi Tree</h1>
      <p class="body">Having abandoned extreme ascetic practices, Siddhartha regained his physical strength by accepting food from a kind village girl named Sujata. With renewed energy and clarity, he resolved to meditate under a Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, vowing not to rise until he had attained enlightenment.

        During his meditation, Siddhartha faced numerous challenges and temptations, which were personified by Mara, the demon of desire and illusion. Mara attempted to distract him with visions of fear, doubt, and worldly pleasures. However, Siddhartha remained steadfast, using his mindfulness and concentration to overcome each temptation.
        
        As the night progressed, Siddhartha delved deeper into the nature of existence. He gained profound insights into the workings of the mind, the causes of suffering, and the interconnectedness of all life forms. By dawn, he had achieved a complete and unshakable understanding of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, which would form the core teachings of Buddhism.</p>

      <h1 class="heading">The Moment of Enlightenment</h1>
      <p class="body">As the morning star rose on that fateful day, Siddhartha experienced a profound transformation. He had transcended ignorance and desire, attaining supreme wisdom and compassion. He became the Buddha, meaning "The Enlightened One."

        The enlightenment of Siddhartha Gautama was not just a personal triumph but a universal breakthrough that offered humanity a path to liberation from suffering. The Buddha's realization was rooted in the understanding that suffering arises from craving and attachment and that liberation is possible through ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom..</p>
