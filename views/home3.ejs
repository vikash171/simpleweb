      <h1 class="heading">The Origins of Buddha’s Compassion and Wisdom</h1>
      <p class="body">Siddhartha Gautama, who later became the Buddha, was born into a royal family in Kapilavastu. Despite being surrounded by wealth and comfort, he was deeply moved by the suffering he observed in the world. The pivotal moment came when he encountered the Four Sights: an old man, a sick person, a corpse, and an ascetic. These experiences awakened a profound sense of compassion and a desire to understand the root causes of suffering.

        After renouncing his royal life, Siddhartha embarked on a rigorous spiritual quest. His journey was marked by years of ascetic practices and meditation. Through his experiences, he realized that both indulgence and extreme self-denial were obstacles to true understanding. This realization led him to discover the Middle Way, a path of balance and wisdom..</p>

      <h1 class="heading">Compassion as a Core Teaching</h1>
      <p class="body">Compassion, or Karuna, is a fundamental aspect of Buddha’s teachings. It is the heartfelt desire to alleviate the suffering of others. Buddha emphasized that true compassion extends beyond mere sympathy; it requires understanding, empathy, and a commitment to helping others without expecting anything in return.

        One of the most notable examples of Buddha’s compassion is his encounter with Angulimala, a notorious bandit who had terrorized the region. Instead of condemning him, Buddha approached Angulimala with kindness and understanding. Through their interaction, Angulimala transformed into a devoted follower and lived a life of peace and virtue.
        
        Buddha also taught the practice of Metta Bhavana, or loving-kindness meditation, to cultivate compassion. This practice involves sending thoughts of love, peace, and goodwill to oneself and gradually extending these feelings to all living beings, including those who may be considered enemies.</p>

      <h1 class="heading">Wisdom in Buddha’s Teachings</h1>
      <p class="body">Wisdom, or Prajna, is the profound understanding of the true nature of reality. It involves seeing things as they truly are, free from delusion and ignorance. Buddha’s teachings on wisdom are encapsulated in the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

        The Four Noble Truths
        
        The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha): Life is inherently marked by suffering, whether it is physical pain, emotional distress, or existential dissatisfaction.
        
        The Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Samudaya): Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance.
        
        The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha): It is possible to overcome suffering by eliminating craving and ignorance.
        
        The Truth of the Path (Magga): The way to end suffering is through the Eightfold Path.
        
        The Eightfold Path
        
        The Eightfold Path is a comprehensive guide to ethical living, mental discipline, and wisdom. It is divided into three categories:
        
        Ethical Conduct (Sila): Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood.
        
        Mental Discipline (Samadhi): Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.
        
        Wisdom (Prajna): Right View and Right Intention.
        
        Buddha emphasized that wisdom and compassion are inseparable. Wisdom without compassion can be cold and detached, while compassion without wisdom can be misguided. Together, they form the foundation for a harmonious and enlightened life.</p>
