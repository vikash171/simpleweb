      <h1 class="heading">Birth and Royal Lineage</h1>
      <p class="body">Siddhartha Gautama was born in 563 BCE in the Lumbini region, which is present-day Nepal. He belonged to the Shakya clan, a warrior and administrative class that governed the region of Kapilavastu. His father, King Suddhodana, was a powerful and respected leader of the Shakya kingdom. Siddhartha’s mother, Queen Maya, was known for her piety and virtue. Siddhartha's birth is surrounded by numerous miraculous legends. One of the most famous stories describes Queen Maya having a divine dream before his birth, where a white elephant entered her side—a sign interpreted by sages as the birth of a great being destined to be either a world-conquering monarch or an enlightened spiritual teacher.

        According to tradition, Siddhartha’s birth took place in a grove at Lumbini. It is said that as soon as he was born, he took seven steps, and lotus flowers blossomed under his feet. These events symbolized his future greatness. Despite these auspicious signs, Siddhartha was raised as an ordinary prince, albeit in a luxurious environment that shielded him from the harsh realities of life.</p>

      <h1 class="heading">Childhood in Kapilavastu</h1>
      <p class="body">Siddhartha grew up in the opulent royal palace of Kapilavastu. His father, King Suddhodana, was determined to groom him as a future king and ensure that he would not be drawn toward spiritual pursuits. To achieve this, the king provided Siddhartha with an environment filled with indulgence, pleasure, and comfort. He surrounded his son with music, entertainment, and beautiful gardens, sparing no effort to keep him happy and content.

        From a young age, Siddhartha displayed remarkable intelligence, compassion, and physical prowess. He was highly skilled in martial arts, archery, and other princely activities. Despite excelling in these pursuits, Siddhartha exhibited a contemplative nature, often pondering profound questions about life and existence.</p>
