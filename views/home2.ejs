      <h1 class="heading">Teaching the Path to Enlightenment</h1>
      <p class="body">After his enlightenment, the Buddha initially hesitated to share his insights, believing that the truths he had discovered were too profound for others to grasp. However, his compassion for all living beings compelled him to teach. He delivered his first sermon at Deer Park in Sarnath, where he expounded the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path to five ascetics who had previously been his companions.

        This event, known as the "Turning of the Wheel of Dharma," marked the beginning of the Buddha's forty-five years of teaching. His message spread far and wide, attracting followers from all walks of life. The Buddha's teachings emphasized self-awareness, ethical living, and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion.</p>
